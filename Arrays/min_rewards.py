# Root approach: get min one by one and apply counting logic: if received min & previous min are adjacent, increment counter, else use the same counter

# Approach I: Use heap to get min one by one and aply counting logic
# Approach II: Create an index array from the numbers and sort the 

# Both techniques will be O(nlogn). I think II will need extra O(n) space due to the extra index array  
# 1. can go with II & discuss improvement of using heap as heap implementation will take time and will be another problem in itself
# 2. can also abstract heap implementaion and assume it as a library and later code it if you have time

# Learning:
# !. Weighing two solutions and choosing the best (whichever ensures best results in an interview)

# Implemented II:
def minRewards(scores):
    # Write your code here.
    pass
